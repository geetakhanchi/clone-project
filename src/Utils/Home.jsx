          <p>
            We want to thank you for inviting us to be a part of your journey
            and for the privilege of earning your support and enthusiasm for the
            brand. SparkPeople's business model has always been free and was
            driven by advertiser support, a model that became difficult to
            maintain in recent years. With many larger technology companies
            emerging in the health and fitness space, we struggled to compete
            for the same advertising dollars that would keep the site online and
            alive. Unfortunately, it costs many millions of dollars per year to
            run SparkPeople, and the burden eventually became too much.
            <br />
            SparkAmerica is part of our new business model, in which we work
            with companies and organizations to help keep their employees
            healthy with PeopleOne Health. Not only does this business model
            allow us to expand our health offerings to more people, but it also
            does a much better job of paying the bills and will likely allow us
            to hire more people over time to keep improving our tech offerings.
            We're very excited that we can open up our website and app for this
            business while keeping it free to help all individuals and
            organizations in the United States achieve their health and fitness
            goals.
